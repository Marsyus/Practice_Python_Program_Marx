#Prog05: Create a program that ask user to input 2 numbers. Print the quotient of the two numbers with the decimal point
num_01 = int(input("Enter your first number: "))
num_02 = int(input("Enter your second number: "))
quotient = num_01 / num_02
print(f"The quotient of both numbers, {num_01} and {num_02}, is {quotient}!")
